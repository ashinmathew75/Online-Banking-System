    <H2>Ashin Thomas - Full Stack Java Developer </H2>
    <p>
    I’m a full-stack software developer with experience in PEGA application development and web-based java development. I recently graduated from the University of Maryland (UMBC) with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science along with Data Science Track. I've always been interested in this field because it allows me to create ideas in my head and then see them come to reality within an application has always excited me.

	I also enjoyed developing mobile apps that mainly focused on android based. In UMBC, I created a Covid-19 case tracker and for Montgomery College, I created an app called Purple Plan where students can make appointments and schedule meetings with advisors. Having experience in creating these apps provided me the opportunity to work at Hughes Network System where I was in charge of prototyping survey features that can be added to their existing apps.

	During my time in Revature, I had the opportunities to work on many projects using Java, SQL, JDBC  framework in the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap frameworks in the front-end.  I also worked on creating full-stack PEGA applications. One of the things that I enjoyed most in Revature was collaborating with team environments where I can learn from others. It has really helped me to improve my soft skills as well as my software development skills.
